# FDiscord
This is a small C# Windows application I made to annoy some of my friends on Discord

## What does it do then?
It gives the user the ability to spam messages, friend requests and join servers<br>
with more than one account at a time, you just need to have the accounts' tokens

## Dear god, why?
Well I don't know... I just wanted to code something in C#

## But it sucks and the code is buggy
Totally agree with you, maybe someday I will update it... who knows

# NOTICE
This is just a proof of concept,
you will be held responsible for your actions
